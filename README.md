**Sales Dashboard Showcase**

After analyzing our sales data, I've created this interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into our business performance. The dashboard highlights:
Total sales of â‚¹3,22,967 with unit price analytics
Product category breakdowns showing Electronics, Fashion, and Food as top performers
Geographic distribution across Mandalay, Naypyitaw, and Yangon
Gender-based purchasing patterns showing strong female customer contributions
Payment method preferences (Cash 35%, Credit Card 31%, E-wallet 34%)
Using filters for customer type, location, product line, and gender allows our team to quickly identify trends and make data-driven decisions.
